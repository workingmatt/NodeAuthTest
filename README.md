Node Authentication Test

Based on a tutorial by Chris Sevilleja at http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/easy-node-authentication-setup-and-local

The full tutorial covers authentication using a variety of 'strategies', this example only does local strategy i.e. email/password. The full tutorial does authentication via google, facebook and I think other accounts too.

Another difference in this code is that I used jade instead of .ejs This may be the most useful difference other than showing the tutorial works. This code, pretty much straight from the tutorial, works but you need to put in your modulus.io mongoDB username/password into ./config/database.js. As the tutorial suggests you can sign up for a mongoDB account at https://modulus.io/
